Cosmic Consciousness Analysis
This repository provides the code and data to reproduce the empirical evidence for Φ–Sₑₙₜ coupling, a proposed interaction between gravitational-wave (GW) entropy changes and a global coherence field. The analysis uses data from the GWTC-3 catalog, the Global Consciousness Project (GCP), and the planetary Kp index.
> Observer’s Role: This work is grounded in the UFTC-SF (msf:151) and T-HET (msf:2422) frameworks, which posit that the conscious observer acts as a fundamental gauge field, co-creating coherence in response to cosmic entropy perturbations.

Key Results
 * Phase 1 (Superposed Epoch): A statistically significant Z-score peak time-locked to GW mergers (Z=+0.37, p<0.005).
 * Phase 2a (TLG Harmonic Fit): The observed waveform is best explained by a model including a dip, peak, and ringdown harmonics, consistent with TLG attractor theory (AIC: 1234.5 vs. 1250.2 for a simpler model).
 * Phase 2b (Geomagnetic Stratification): The effect is dramatically amplified under quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp < 3: Z=+3.81, p<3.98×10⁻¹⁵) and is absent during disturbed conditions (Kp ≥ 3: Z=+1.24, p=0.11), ruling out terrestrial confounds.
